You are given an integer array nums and an integer k.

In one operation, you can pick two numbers from the array whose sum equals k and remove them from the array.

Return the maximum number of operations you can perform on the array.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Starting with nums = [1,2,3,4]:
- Remove numbers 1 and 4, then nums = [2,3]
- Remove numbers 2 and 3, then nums = []
There are no more pairs that sum up to 5, hence a total of 2 operations.


Solution-

class Solution {
    public int maxOperations(int[] nums, int k) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int i=0;
        int j = nums.length-1;
        int count=0;
        while(i<j){
            if(nums[i]+nums[j]==k){
                count++;
                i++;
                j--;
            }
            else if(nums[i]+nums[j]>k)j--;
            else i++;
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
