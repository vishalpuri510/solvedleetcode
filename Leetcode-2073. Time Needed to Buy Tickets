Question-There are n people in a line queuing to buy tickets, where the 0th person is at the front of the line and the (n - 1)th person 
is at the back of the line.

You are given a 0-indexed integer array tickets of length n where the number of tickets that the ith person would like to buy is tickets[i].

Each person takes exactly 1 second to buy a ticket. A person can only buy 1 ticket at a time and has to go back to the end of the line 
(which happens instantaneously) in order to buy more tickets. If a person does not have any tickets left to buy, the person will leave the line.

Return the time taken for the person at position k (0-indexed) to finish buying tickets.

Solution-

class Solution {
    public int timeRequiredToBuy(int[] tickets, int k) {
        int time = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < tickets.length; i++) {
            if(i <= k) {
                time += Math.min(tickets[i], tickets[k]);
            } else {
                time += Math.min(tickets[i], tickets[k] - 1);
            }
        }
        return time;
    }
}
